introduction: |
  Welcome to the repository for the Particle Snowflake
  , a limited edition [Particle P2](https://store.particle.io/products/p2-wi-fi-module-cut-tape-x10) powered PCBA in the form of a snowflake. The Snowflake provides a seasonal light show and plays a classic holiday tune.

  The Particle Snowflake is a festive device built around the Particle P2 WiFi module, designed for holiday decoration with interactive features. It boasts:
  - 36 individually addressable RGB LEDs to create various lighting patterns and colors
  - An onboard speaker for playing classic holiday tunes
  - A PDM microphone for potential voice-activated or sound-reactive functionality

  The Snowflake can be used as a unique decoration on a tree, hung as an ornament, or displayed on a stand with a USB-C power supply. With open-source firmware and hardware files available, this project is also a fun opportunity for custom modifications or additional features. The project includes the schematic, PCB files, and prebuilt assets for easy setup and customization.
